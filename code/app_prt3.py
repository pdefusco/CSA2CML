    First, we can view some summary statistics.
    The `duration` variable is the duration of an eruption in minutes,
    and the `waiting` variable is the time between eruptions in minutes.

"""
So the mean waiting time between eruptions is around 70 minutes,
with a mean eruption duration of three and a half minutes.
Summary statistics can be misleading.
Let us plot the waiting and duration variables against each other.

We'll use a joint density plot, with the marginal densities for each
variable on the corresponding axis.
There are clearly two clusters:
shorter eruptions with a shorter waiting time,
and longer eruptions with a longer waiting time.
These are labeled in our data set, so we separate the data and color by cluster.
